# Hi, my name is Kjetil Paulsen
Welcome to my portfolio! This repository is currently outdated, but is supposed to showcase the projects I've developed to demonstrate my skills in Python programming, web development, and problem-solving. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project with links to their respective repositories. As I have been otherwise occupied with studies, this portfolio has been put on the backburner. I have learned loads, and realized the need for restructuring and refactoring my own code and my own projects, and as my official studies come to an end, I will be able to further develop these repositories. I have already started this work in my journal-repo, as this is a program I use daily, and is dear to me. But as mentioned, sadly, these repos are not up to date with, or representative of, my current knowledge or skill, and are in need of refactoring.

My interests lie in the intersection between data analytics, programming and math, genetic algorithms and neural networks. My main languge isbPython, but I am currently trying to expand my skills in C.

## Featured Projects

### 4. [**Terminal Journal**](https://github.com/noorac/journal)  
*Fifth project*

A Python-based journaling application built with the `curses` library, providing a minimalist, keyboard-driven interface for writing, browsing, and managing personal entries directly in the terminal. The project focuses on low-level UI control, efficient text handling, and a distraction-free writing environment.

- **Features**:  
  - Full-screen terminal interface powered by `curses`.  
  - Create, edit, and navigate journal entries using keyboard shortcuts.  
  - Structured storage and retrieval of entries for long-term use.  
  - Designed for extensibility (search, tagging, encryption, etc.).  

- **Skills Demonstrated**:  
  - Terminal UI programming with `curses`  
  - File I/O and text processing  
  - State management and user interaction design  
  - Python application architecture

### 1. [**Todotra**](https://github.com/noorac/todotra) 
*First project*

A lightweight and efficient to-do tracker written in Python, designed for terminal-based productivity enthusiasts(The main reason for showcasing this is because no portfolio is complete without a todo-list).

- **Features**:
  - Add, remove, and list tasks directly from the terminal.
  - Persistent task storage with a simple, human-readable format.
- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - File I/O
  - Command-line interface design
  - Python fundamentals
