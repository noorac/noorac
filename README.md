# Hi, my name is Kjetil Paulsen
Welcome to my portfolio! This collection is currently somewhat outdated, but is supposed to showcase the projects I've developed to demonstrate my skills in Python programming, software development and problem-solving. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project with links to their respective repositories. As I have been otherwise occupied with studies, this portfolio has been put on the backburner. I have learned a lot through my studies, and realized the need for restructuring and refactoring my own code and my own projects, and as my official studies have come to an end, I will be able to further develop these repositories. I have already started some of this work but as I am continously learning, I am continously seeing room for improvements, and in a constant loop of refactoring.

My interests lie in the intersection between software development, data analysis, mathemathics, genetic algorithms and neural networks. My main languge is Python, but I am currently trying to expand my skills in C/C++/Kotlin.

Some projects, especially when testing new languages, contain code generated by AI. In these cases I am mainly showcasing my architectural, not syntactic, understanding of the development process.

## Featured Projects

### 1. [**Trilobite**](https://github.com/noorac/trilobite) 
*In an effort to modularize and concretesize my apps, this repo is likely to be split into several smaller repos with distinct skills demonstrated*

A Python-based financial analysis tool designed to download, store, analyze, and visualize stock market data.

- **Features**:  
  - Fetch and process financial data using the Yahoo Finance API via `yfinance`, then store data in PostgreSQL.  
  - Tools for analyzing and visualizing trends in stock data.  

- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - API integration (Yahoo Finance)
  - Basic CRUD in PostgreSQL
  - Data analysis and visualization  
  - Python programming and modular design

### 2. [**Terminal Journal**](https://github.com/noorac/journal)  
*While this program is currently functional, it lacks in abstraction and architecture. Because of newly learned skills in API between FE & BE, and abstractions, as well as understanding of databases this app is likely to get a significant refactor*

A Python-based journaling application built with the `curses` library, providing a minimalist, keyboard-driven interface for writing, browsing, and managing personal entries directly in the terminal. The project focuses on low-level UI control, efficient text handling, and a distraction-free writing environment.

- **Features**:  
  - Full-screen terminal interface powered by `curses`.  
  - Create, edit, and navigate journal entries using keyboard shortcuts.  
  - Structured storage and retrieval of entries for long-term use.   

- **Skills Demonstrated**:  
  - Terminal UI programming with `curses`  
  - File I/O and text processing  
  - State management and user interaction design

### 3. [**Py-Sorting-Algorithms**](https://github.com/noorac/py-sorting-algorithms) 
*This project has not been updated in a long time and does not reflect my current knowledge*

A collection of sorting algorithms implemented in Python, complete with detailed comments and modular design.

- **Highlights**:
  - Includes Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Shell Sort, and more.

- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - Algorithm design

### 4. [**Pwdgen**](https://github.com/noorac/pwdgen) 
*This project has not been updated in a long time and does not reflect my current knowledge*

A Python-based password generator that creates strong, customizable passwords. This tool is practical and I use it every time I need to create a new password.

- **Features**:
  - Adjustable length and complexity.
  - Supports special characters, numbers, and uppercase/lowercase letters.
- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - Randomization techniques
  - User input handling
  - Practical Python scripting

### 5. [**Psychology Practice Website**](https://gbpsicoterapia.it/en) 
*This project is more of a sideproject to help a relative, and is not meat to demonstrate anything other than very basic knowledge of webdesign*

A WordPress-based website designed for a private psychology practice, featuring custom content and an approachable design.

- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - Website planning and design
  - Content management with WordPress
  - Client communication and project iteration
