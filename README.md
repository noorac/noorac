<h1>Hi, my name is Kjetil!ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h5>This portfolio was started not too long ago, and is therefore not very populated with projects. I am slowly both adding new repos/projects, but aldo adding new features to my current projects. .</h5>
<h4>My main focus is on Python programming(including libraries like pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy), but I also venture into HTML/CSS and have just recently starter playing with JS. In the past I have tried a bit of Java and C++. In the future I am thinking of dipping myself once again in C++, but also further my knowledge of the LAMP/MERN stacks.</h4>
