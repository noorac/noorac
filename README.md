# Hi, my name is Kjetil Paulsen
Welcome to my portfolio! This collection is currently somewhat outdated, but is supposed to showcase the projects I've developed to demonstrate my skills in Python programming, web development, and problem-solving. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project with links to their respective repositories. As I have been otherwise occupied with studies, this portfolio has been put on the backburner. I have learned a lot, and realized the need for restructuring and refactoring my own code and my own projects, and as my official studies come to an end, I will be able to further develop these repositories. I have already started some of this work in my journal-repo, as this is a program I use daily, and is dear to me. But as mentioned, some of these repos are not up to date with, or representative of, my current knowledge or skill, and are in need of refactoring.

My interests lie in the intersection between software development, data analysis, mathemathics, genetic algorithms and neural networks. My main languge is Python, but I am currently trying to expand my skills in C/C++.

## Featured Projects

### 1. [**Trilobite**](https://github.com/noorac/trilobite) 
*This project is being redone, and so the old version is deprecated, and this one is under development*

A Python-based financial analysis tool designed to download, analyze, and visualize stock market data. Trilobite leverages data manipulation and visualization techniques, and aims to include machine learning capabilities in future iterations. Keep in mind this project is in the early stages.

- **Features**:  
  - Fetch and process financial data using the Yahoo Finance API via `yfinance`.  
  - Tools for analyzing and visualizing trends in stock data.  
  - Modular design for future integration of predictive models and AI.  

- **Skills Demonstrated**:  
  - Data analysis and visualization  
  - API integration (Yahoo Finance)  
  - Python programming and modular design

### 2. [**Terminal Journal**](https://github.com/noorac/journal)  

A Python-based journaling application built with the `curses` library, providing a minimalist, keyboard-driven interface for writing, browsing, and managing personal entries directly in the terminal. The project focuses on low-level UI control, efficient text handling, and a distraction-free writing environment.

- **Features**:  
  - Full-screen terminal interface powered by `curses`.  
  - Create, edit, and navigate journal entries using keyboard shortcuts.  
  - Structured storage and retrieval of entries for long-term use.  
  - Designed for extensibility (search, tagging, encryption, etc.).  

- **Skills Demonstrated**:  
  - Terminal UI programming with `curses`  
  - File I/O and text processing  
  - State management and user interaction design  
  - Python application architecture

### 3. [**Py-Sorting-Algorithms**](https://github.com/noorac/py-sorting-algorithms) 
*This project has not been updated in a long time and does not reflect my current knowledge*

A collection of sorting algorithms implemented in Python, complete with detailed comments and modular design.

- **Highlights**:
  - Includes Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Shell Sort, and more.
  - Comprehensive documentation and example use cases.
- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - Algorithm design and analysis
  - Writing clean, modular, and efficient code
  - Educational documentation

### 4. [**Pwdgen**](https://github.com/noorac/pwdgen) 
*This project has not been updated in a long time and does not reflect my current knowledge*

A Python-based password generator that creates strong, customizable passwords. This tool is practical and I use it every time I need to create a new password.

- **Features**:
  - Adjustable length and complexity.
  - Supports special characters, numbers, and uppercase/lowercase letters.
- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - Randomization techniques
  - User input handling
  - Practical Python scripting

### 5. [**Psychology Practice Website**](https://gbpsicoterapia.it/en) 
*This project is more of a sideproject to help relatives, and is not meat to demonstrate anything other than very basic knowledge of webdesign*
A WordPress-based website designed for a private psychology practice, featuring custom content and an approachable design.

- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - Website planning and design
  - Content management with WordPress
  - Client communication and project iteration

*Note: This project is ongoing.*
